Personal blog about development where I share some of my work.

Built with Next.js, deployed on Vercel. 

At first, I wanted to play a little with Next.js and I decided to move the few posts I've been publishing on Medium up in here.
I also discovered [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) that I wanted to try for a long time now, 
and it just made me realized how bad I am at designing stuff ðŸ˜…

## Roadmap

- Integrate Twitter feed with last tweets (CORS Issue in January 2024 âœ…)
- Add a navigation menu and a "About me" page
- Build a theme for the website to make it more attractive :-Â°
- Add a search functionality
- Add a "Correct this blog post on GitHub" button 

### Done
- Upgrade to latest version v14 of Next.js (January 2024 âœ…)

Some of my posts are also available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mnu)
