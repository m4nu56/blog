Personal blog about development where I share some of my work.

Built with next.js, deployed on Vercel. 

At first I wanted to play a little with NextJS and I decided to move the few posts I've been publishing on Medium up in here.
I also discovered [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) that I wanted to try for a long time now and it just made me realized how bad I am at designing stuff :-)

## Roadmap

- Integrate twitter feed with last tweets (CORS Issue in January 2024 √)
- Add a navigation menu and a "About me" page
- Build a theme for the website to make it more attractive :-°
- Add a search functionnality
- Add a "Correct this blog post on GitHub" button 

### Done
- Upgrade to latest version of NextJS (v14 January 2024 √)

Some of my posts are also available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mnu)
