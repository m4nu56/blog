# Backup and restore postgres databases using cli tools

As usual [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/app-pgdump.html) is very well designed and you can find info of all the tools one can use to backup and restore databases as well as a lot of examples.

This post is more of a quick reminder of the most common script I use on a daily basis. You won't find an exhaustive list of all available options.

## How to backup a database

```bash
pg_dump dbname -h localhost -U username -n schema_name -O -v -b -Fc > /path/to/backup/file.backup
```

- `-h` or `--host` where is running the postgres server
- `-U` or `--username` to specify the user
- `-n` or `--schema` to specify the schema. You can select multiple schemas by duplicating the `-n` option. If the schema depends on objects in other schemas those will not be backup. Blob as well are not backup unless you add the `--blobs switch`
- `-b` or `--blobs` backup blob data
- `-O` or `--no-owner` to discard original ownership of the objects in the backup file
- `-v` or `--verbose` verbose mode
- `-Fc` or `format=c` format custom. Use this mode when you need a compressed file. This format can be restored using `pg_restore`. If format is not specified it will be a plain SQL script by default.

Or:
```bash
pg_dump --file "/path/to/backup/file.backup"
    --host=localhost
    --username "userName"
    --no-password
    --verbose
    --format=c
    --blobs
    --no-owner
    --schema bre_anren_2020_2021
    dbname
```

## Restore using pg_restore

To restore a backup generated with the `-Fc` format option:

```bash
pg_restore --host=localhost -U username -d dbname -Fc -v < /path/to/backup/file.backup
```

- `--host` where is running the postgres server
- `-U` or `--username` to specify the user
- `-d` name of the database


## Restore using psql

Todo

## Note on using it with docker

Most of the time I'm using these tools on a Docker container. You simply need to execute it with:

```bash
docker exec -i container_name pg_dump dbname > /path/to/backup/file.backup
```

`/path/to/backup/file.backup` will be in the container so one way to download it would be to volume the directory with your host.
Or use: `docker cp <containerName>:/path/to/backup/file.backup /host/path/`


## Restore a backup without running the refresh of the materialized view

The solution consists in extracting from your backup the list the table of contents with the `-l` or `--list` option.
Altering this list of contents to remove the refresh of the views.
And then launching the backup using the table of contents as parameter with the `-L` or `--list-file` option.

```bash
# backup in custom format
pg_dump database -Fc backup.dump

# generate the table of contents and remove MATERIALIZED VIEW DATA
pg_restore -l backup.dump | sed '/MATERIALIZED VIEW DATA/d' > refresh.lst

# restore using the table of contents as parameter
pg_restore -L refresh.lst -d database backup.dump

# generate the table of contents with only the materialized view data
pg_restore -l backup.dump | grep 'MATERIALIZED VIEW DATA' > refresh.lst

# restore the backup executing only the refresh of the materialized views
pg_restore -L refresh.lst -d database backup.dump
```

If you need to restore it on a docker container the list file must be on the container.
You need to copy it on the container before running the pg_restore command.

```bash
# generate the table of contents and remove MATERIALIZED VIEW DATA
# using your host `pg_restore`
pg_restore -l backup.dump | sed '/MATERIALIZED VIEW DATA/d' > refresh.lst

# copy the table of contents file on the container
docker cp refresh.lst containerName:/tmp

# restore the backup executing only the refresh of the materialized views
# on your running container `containerName`
docker exec -i containerName pg_restore -L /tmp/refresh.lst -U username -d database -Fc -v /host/path/backup.dump
```

## Disconnect all client before doing a restore

If you need to restore a database on a database that is actively used you'll need to disconnect all clients before doing so:

```sql
SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid)
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'dbname'
AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
```
