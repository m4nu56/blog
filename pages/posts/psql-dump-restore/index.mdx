# Update a PostgreSQL table using a WITH query

I often need to update a table using values from a different table and most of the time the quickest and also dirtiest solution is simply to do a subquery.
A better and cleaner solution is to use the [UPDATE .. SET .. FROM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-update.html):

Let's describe our case with an example:

I have a table `journey_pattern` in which I need to update the name based on the name of its line. I can find the line by joining 2 other tables: `routes` and `lines`.

Using a subquery I can simply do:

```sql
UPDATE journey_patterns p SET name = (
    SELECT l.name
    FROM journey_patterns jp
             JOIN routes r ON jp.route_id = r.id
             JOIN lines l ON r.line_id = l.id
    WHERE l.name IS NOT NULL
      AND l.name <> ''
    AND jp.id = p.id
) || ' - ' || name
```

But what if `lines.name` is empty or null ? I need to check that case using a `CASE .. THEN .. ELSE .. END`. The inline subquery will end up being quite difficult to read.

As you can see on the Postgresql UPDATE documentation, we can use a [WITH QUERY](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/queries-with.html) to update our table:

So in our case:

```sql
WITH line_journey_pattern AS (
    SELECT jp.id AS journey_pattern_id, l.name AS line_name
    FROM journey_patterns jp
             JOIN routes r ON jp.route_id = r.id
             JOIN lines l ON r.line_id = l.id
    WHERE l.name IS NOT NULL
      AND l.name <> ''
)
UPDATE journey_patterns jp
SET name = ljp.line_name || ' - ' || jp.name
FROM line_journey_pattern ljp
WHERE ljp.journey_pattern_id = jp.id;
```

The `WITH` statement is used to regroup a `journey_pattern` with a `lines.name` and we only return line names being not null and not empty.
We can then do a `UPDATE .. SET .. FROM .. WHERE` to update our `journey_pattern.name`.

And the cherry is that this update is done only when `lines.name` is set.
